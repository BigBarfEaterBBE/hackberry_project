# hackberry_project
My project for hackberry!!
To familiarize myself with OpenCV, I used: https://learnopencv.com/getting-started-with-opencv/
For the face recognition I followed this tutorial: https://www.hackster.io/mjrobot/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-a10826#toc-step-5--data-gathering-7
But I edited it slightly by adding glob to count existimg images so when I saved testing data it would add on new files instead of overwriting old ones
