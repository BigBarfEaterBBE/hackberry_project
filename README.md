# hackberry_project
My project for hackberry!!
To familiarize myself with OpenCV, I used: https://learnopencv.com/getting-started-with-opencv/
For the face recognition I followed this tutorial for the framework: https://www.hackster.io/mjrobot/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-a10826#toc-step-5--data-gathering-7
But instead of using Haar cascades for recognition I used OpenCV deep learning facial recognition and added glob to count how many current files I had for a given userID so it would add more samples instead of replacing old ones
This is the repo I used for OpenCV deep learning facial recognition resources: https://github.com/alvareson/caffe-model-for-face-detection?utm_source=chatgpt.com
